# CRANCKY flix - Movie Collection Manager

## 📽️ Project Overview
CRANCKY flix is a personal movie collection management web application that allows users to keep track of movies they've watched. Users can add, view, search, and delete movies from their personal collection, with all data persisted in the browser's localStorage.

## 🎯 Problem Solved
Movie enthusiasts often struggle to remember which movies they've watched, their ratings, and thoughts about films. CRANCKY flix solves this by providing a simple, elegant interface to:
- Keep a personal record of watched movies
- Rate and review films
- Search and filter through collections
- Access data anytime without creating accounts

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- HTML5 (Semantic markup)
- CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid, Media Queries)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- LocalStorage for data persistence
- Google Fonts (Inter)
- GitHub Pages for hosting

## ✨ Features
- **3 Linked Pages**: Home, Collection, and Add Movie
- **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- **Form Validation**: Real-time validation with error messages
- **LocalStorage**: Data persists between sessions
- **Search & Filter**: Find movies by title or genre
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, and Delete movies
- **Dynamic UI**: Real-time updates without page reloads

## 📱 Responsive Breakpoints
- Desktop: >1024px
- Tablet: 768px - 1024px
- Mobile: <768px

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Visit the live site or open index.html locally
2. Navigate to "Add Movie" to add your first movie
3. Fill out the form (title, genre, year, rating, review)
4. View all movies in the "Collection" page
5. Use search/filter to find specific movies
6. Delete movies you no longer want

## 💾 Data Storage
All movie data is stored in your browser's localStorage. This means:
- Your collection is private to your browser
- No account needed
- Data persists until browser cache is cleared
- Different browsers have separate collections

## 🐛 Known Bugs/Limitations
- Images cannot be uploaded (requires backend)
- No user authentication (intentional for simplicity)
- Maximum storage limited by browser (usually 5-10MB)
- Data is browser-specific (can't access from different devices)
